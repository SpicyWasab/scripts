# scripts
My script project.

Its' a few set of scripts, in a folder on my PC, that I added to my $PATH to use it globally.

I sent them on Github to use them on my phone through Termux. 

It is supposed to contain a lot of tiny scripts, for now :
	1. [ytdl](https://github.com/SpicyWasab/script-ytdl)
	2. [ecole-directe-moyenne](https://github.com/SpicyWasab/script-ecole-directe-moyenne)

Those are currently written in JavaScript using Node.js
